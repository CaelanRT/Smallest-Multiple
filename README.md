# Smallest-Multiple

This program solves the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 20 inclusive problem. I had a lot of fun writing this, it was a good brain teaser. This solution is unfortunately really slow but does end up producing the right number. I will continue to work on this and get better at writing quicker solutions.
